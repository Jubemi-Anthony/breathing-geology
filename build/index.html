                        Before entering Uniben I was excited about the compliments I received for getting to study Geology. However on getting here I discovered that it was a sweet course although there were some challenging parts. The journey was far from smooth but overall I love Geology. I love what I do and I love the branch of Geology I am into. I love the application and everything about it. It's a bitter sweet story which is what makes it interesting. I don't know everything about Geology but I am perfect in the aspects I know and I know it from my heart.

                        I remember after gaining admission into the university to study Geology, I was happy because I had gotten admission on the first try but on the other hand, I was sad because that wasn't what I wanted and thought of transferring to another course of study, but I decided to give it a try first.
                        <br>
                        The first lecture I received in Geology made me feel better about the course of study. I thought to myself "this isn't bad at all....it's actually interesting and wonderful.... I'm definitely going to stay here (study it)". <br>
                        But overtime as I attended more lectures, I started to feel lost because the information was getting "too much". <br>
                        But I learned that geology is a course that feels "too much" because it unravels the history and processes within the earth, and other terrestrial planets which is a lot üòÇ so I had to take it one step at a time.<br>
                        Geology contains various fields of Interest which are all enlightening and Captivating and all of these boils down to studying properties and processes of the earth.

                        Studying Geology felt like stepping into a world where the Earth's history was waiting to be unlocked. I had always wanted to study Geology. At first, I was so happy I got it, but then at some point I didn't know what I was doing. Everything confused me in my first year. This continued into the first semester of my second year. During those times I realised that I didn't have any solid reason for choosing this. I was on the verge of giving up. Over the short break I did some thinking and it was clear to me that the reason I felt that way was because I wasn't letting myself enjoy the course at all. When I returned I was determined to let Geology flow through and since then it has never been the same. I started to engage in stimulating discussions with faculty members and fellow students about ongoing research projects and the latest advancements in the field of geology. This was a life changing decision. I got to enjoy how brain racking Geology is. The branches of Geology I enjoyed learning the most were Petrology, Sedimentology and Geotectonics. Geology changed the way I view my surroundings. Everywhere I go I always try to bring the Geology out of the place, and I hope to use it to change the world in my own little way.

                        Studying Geology in Nigeria, not as easy as it can be.
                        It is a lot of fun studying the activities in space and those beneath the earth surface.
                        I learnt a lot from my stay in geology. I'd like to compare ourselves with doctors because they tend to dissect the activities that occur in the innermost part of humans, so also, we dissect the activities that occurred/occurs in the innermost parts of the earth.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, Geology taught me how to broaden my imagination, which is all things beautiful. 
                        The fieldwork exercise is one to talk about (it is not all that comfortable) but it is one to commend. The activities and the lessons learnt are like bringing those things that be not (our imaginations) as though they were.
                        All though it is stressful with a lot of work and so much to comprehend in a short time, like trying to fathom what occurred 3 billion years ago in three months. Geology is a beautiful Course. We can boldly talk about what has occurred, what is occurring and what will occur in a particular region.
